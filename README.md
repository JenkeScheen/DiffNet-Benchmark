#### Repository for benchmarking DiffNet vs. LOMAP network generation

- diffnet_loop_COX.py loops Diffnet over n nodes

- lomap_scaling/lomap_*.py loops LOMAP over n nodes
- plot_performances.py plots each model's performance over time



- To extract CPU usage run monitor_system.sh in the background.

Benchmarking is run on a 20-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz

DiffNet is a Python tool for finding optimal allocations of sampling
in computational or experimental measurements of the individual
quantities and their pairwise differences, so as to minimize the covariance
in the estimated quantities.
